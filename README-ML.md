🤖 ML Backend – Job Recommendation System
A machine learning-powered engine for personalized job recommendations using both collaborative filtering (SVD) and skill-based classification models. It integrates with a MongoDB database and drives dynamic, user-specific suggestions based on interaction behavior and resume-job matching.

🧠 Core Concepts
User Interactions as Signals: Job applications and bookmarks serve as implicit feedback, indicating interest.

Latent Feature Learning: SVD uncovers hidden patterns in user-job relationships.

Skill Extraction: NLP parses resumes and job descriptions to extract skills.

Job Fit Prediction: ML classifiers predict how well a user's skills match job requirements.

📊 Recommendation Strategies
🔁 Collaborative Filtering (SVD)
Builds a user-job matrix from applications and bookmarks.

Applies Truncated SVD to reduce dimensionality and derive latent user/job features.

Computes predicted interaction scores for unseen jobs.

Filters out already-interacted jobs and recommends top unseen jobs.

🎯 Skill-based Classification
Uses resume parsing (NER + NLP) to extract structured data.

Trains models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes to classify job fit.

Predicts compatibility score between parsed resume skills and job skills.
